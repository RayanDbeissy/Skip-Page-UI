# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Skip-Page-UI
# Project Overview
This React application allows users to select from different business skip options displayed as cards. Each card shows an image, a title, a hire period, and a price. The skips are sorted by price and displayed in a responsive 3-column grid layout.

# Features Implemented
Dynamic Skip Cards: Cards render dynamically from an array of skip data including title, price, and hire period.

Price Sorting: Skip cards are sorted from lowest to highest price before rendering.

Responsive Grid: Cards are displayed in a 3-column grid with appropriate spacing and sizing.

Selection Handling: Clicking a card selects it visually and enables the Continue button.

Animated Card Entrance: Cards animate into view with different entrance effects based on their position in the grid:

Left column cards slide in from the left.

Middle column cards slide in from top on the first row, and from bottom on the second row.

Right column cards slide in from the right.

Animation Timing: Animations are staggered with delays for a smooth, sequential appearance, each animation lasting 2.6 seconds.

Clean UI/UX: Professional card design with hover effects and clear call-to-action buttons.

# Code Structure
src/App.js: Main component rendering the grid of skip cards, managing selection state, sorting data, and applying animation classes.

src/components/SkipCard.jsx: Reusable card component displaying individual skip details and image.

src/App.css: Styling for layout, cards, animations, buttons, and overall UI.
